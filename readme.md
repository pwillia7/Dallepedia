# Dallepedia Chrome Extension

Dallepedia is a Chrome Extension that enhances the visual experience on Wikipedia by integrating DALL-E generated images. It allows users to toggle between original Wikipedia images and their DALL-E generated counterparts, with a unique feature of saving and retrieving images from a database to optimize the generation process.

## Features

- **Image Toggle**: Users can switch between the original Wikipedia image and a DALL-E generated version.
- **Global Toggle**: A single button to toggle all images on the page between original and DALL-E versions.
- **Efficient Image Processing**: Images generated by DALL-E are saved to a database. When a new user visits the same Wikipedia page, the extension automatically retrieves the already generated images, reducing redundant processing and API calls.
- **Selective Processing**: Only processes images that are visible and meet size criteria.
- **Customizable**: Extension settings can be adjusted via a popup menu.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the code.
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Enable Developer Mode.
4. Drag and drop Dallepedia.crx onto the screen

## Usage

- Once installed, navigate to any Wikipedia page.
- Images that are processed by the extension will have a colored border indicating they can be toggled. 
- Images being processed will have a loading indicator.
- Click the 'Show DALL-E' or 'Show Original' button to toggle images individually.
- Use the global toggle button at the top right corner of the page to switch all images at once.
- To disable DALL-E image generation, use the extension's popup menu.

## Image Storage and Retrieval

- When an image is processed for the first time, the DALL-E generated version is saved to a database.
- For subsequent visits to the same page by any user, the extension retrieves the pre-generated image from the database, ensuring efficient use of resources and faster load times.

## Configuration

- **API Key**: Set your OpenAI API key in the extension's popup menu to enable DALL-E image generation.
- **Enable/Disable**: The extension can be easily enabled or disabled from the popup menu.
