# Dallepedia Chrome Extension

Dallepedia enhances Wikipedia articles by automatically generating modern versions of images using ChatGPT and DALL-E. This process is efficient and user-friendly, as all generated images are saved to a database, ensuring that images only need to be generated once by any user.

The extension allows users to toggle between the original Wikipedia images and their DALL-E generated counterparts, providing a fresh perspective on articles with outdated illustrations or artwork.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the code.
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Enable Developer Mode.
4. Drag and drop Dallepedia.crx onto the screen

## Usage

- After installation, visit any Wikipedia page to see the extension in action.
- Images eligible for DALL-E processing will show a distinct border. Hover over these images to preview the DALL-E version (if hover preview is enabled).
- Click on individual images or use the global toggle button located at the top right of the page to switch between original and DALL-E versions.
- Access extension settings to customize features, including disabling the hover preview or the entire DALL-E image generation.

## Image Storage and Retrieval

- When an image is processed for the first time, the DALL-E generated version is saved to a database.
- For subsequent visits to the same page by any user, the extension retrieves the pre-generated image from the database, ensuring efficient use of resources and faster load times.

## Configuration

- **API Key**: Set your OpenAI API key in the extension's popup menu to enable DALL-E image generation.
- **Enable/Disable**: The extension can be easily enabled or disabled from the popup menu.
